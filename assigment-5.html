    <h1 id="art">  Art Gallery</h1>
    
    <p>
        An art gallery is a room or a building in which visual art is displayed. In Western cultures from the mid-15th century, a gallery was any long, narrow covered passage along a wall, first used in the sense of a place for art in the 1590s.[1] The long gallery in Elizabethan and Jacobean houses served many purposes including the display of art. Historically, art is displayed as evidence of status and wealth, and for religious art as objects of ritual or the depiction of narratives. The first galleries were in the palaces of the aristocracy, or in churches. As art collections grew, buildings became dedicated to art, becoming the first art museums. <br>

        <p>
            Among the modern reasons art may be displayed are aesthetic enjoyment, education, historic preservation, or for marketing purposes. The term is used to refer to establishments with distinct social and economic functions, both public and private. Institutions that preserve a permanent collection may be called either "gallery of art" or "museum of art". If the latter, the rooms where art is displayed within the museum building are called galleries. Art galleries that do not maintain a collection are either commercial enterprises for the sale of artworks, or similar spaces operated by art cooperatives or non-profit organizations. As part of the art world, art galleries play an important role in maintaining the network of connections between artists, collectors, and art experts that define fine art. <br>

         <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>The terms 'art museum' and 'art gallery' may be used interchangeably as reflected in the names of institutions around the world, some of which are called galleries (e.g. the National Gallery and Neue Nationalgalerie), and some of which are called museums (e.g. the Museum of Modern Art and National Museum of Western Art). However, establishments that display art for other purposes, but serve no museum functions, are only called art galleries.</p>

           <h1 id="psl"> PSL Sport Leage</h1>

           <p>The Pakistan Super League (PSL) Urdu: پاکستان سپرلیگ (also known as the HBL PSL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 cricket league contested by six city-based franchise teams. The league was founded in 2015 by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Instead of operating as an association of independently owned teams, the league is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by the investors.[3]

    <h3> 1 :A Rustic Scallion & Chive Panade
    </h3>
    <figure><img src="https://images.101cookbooks.com/panade-recipe-h1.jpg?w=1200&auto=compress&auto=format" alt="" width="600"> <figcaption>The panade recipe in The Zuni Cafe Cookbook came to my attention when a friend baked a beautiful double-version of it in an over-sized AGA dutch oven and served it at a dinner party years ago. It was the show-stopping centerpiece of a meal flanked by a beautiful winter green + chicory salad and gem-shaded glasses of wine. The combination of bubbling cubes of brothy bread and caramelized onions silkily merging with molten threads of cheese is knee-buckling. It’s the perfect example of a short list of the simplest ingredients coming together into something much more than then sum of their parts.</figcaption></figure>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
       <h3>1:</h3> Cut or tear sourdough into rough 1-inch cubes. Set aside.
Caramelize the Onions: <br>
You can prepare these a day or two in advance if you like. You’ll need a large, wide skillet, pan or pot. Place the onions in the pan, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Stir well and season with a couple pinches of salt. They’ll cook down. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to color and begin to caramelize. I like to let them get super jammy, with lots of color, but not-at all burned. This can take about a half hour. Once you’re nearly done cooking the onions, reduce the heat to low and stir in the garlic. Cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. You should end up with 2 or 2 1/2 cups of cooked onions. Set aside. <br> <br>

 <h3>2:</h3>Preheat the oven to 325F. <br> <br>

 <h3>3 :</h3>Place the bread cubes in a large bowl drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/2 cup of the broth. Add 1 cup of the scallions and a few pinches of salt. Use your hands to toss and gently squeeze the bread cubes until evenly moist. Set aside.

 <h1> 2 :Rustic Cabbage Soup</h1>
 <p>Hearty, healthy, and satisfying - this cabbage soup recipe is super simple to make. Slice a cabbage into thin ribbons and cook it down in a simple pot of sautéed potatoes, onions, beans, garlic and flavorful broth. Finish each bowl with a generous drizzle of great olive oil, a couple dollops of sour cream and a jolt of something spicy.</p>

 <h3> Cabbage Soup Ingredients </h3>
 <p> 
    Taking inspiration from a beautiful moon-shaped cabbage and potatoes in the mystery box, I sliced a the cabbage into thin ribbons and cooked it down in a simple pot of sautéed potatoes, beans, onions, garlic and flavorful broth. Each bowl was finished with a generous drizzle of great olive oil, a couple dabs of sour cream and a jolt of something spicy - in this case a bit of Calabrian chile paste. Couldn't be more simple.

 <h3>Cabbage Soup Variations</h3>
 <p>
    Back to the soup - there are a bunch of variations I've made over the years cooking this. Here are a few stand-outs.

Parmesan Cabbage Soup: There are nights when I keep this super simple, finishing things off with a generous dusting of Parmesan cheese and a few chopped herbs.
Curried Cabbage Soup: Add a scant tablespoon of curry powder to the pot prior to stirring in the broth.
Lemony Cabbage Soup: Make the soup as written but serve each bowl topped with freshly grated lemon zest and a generous drizzle of lemon olive oil

        Free-form tarts are the savior of the unfussy cook. Unlike tarts baked in a pan, there’s no need to worry about trimming dough, rolling out perfect circles, or using pie weights. They’re the sort of thing I love to pull from my oven year round, but especially in conjunction with peak tomato season. A beautiful tomato tart layered with jammy, caramelized onions, laced with fresh basil alongside a simple green salad? Good lord yes.

    To the onions here, I add a big pinch of turmeric and lots of black pepper, but you don’t have to. You can think of the onions as their own component and season them as much or little as you like - as long as you imagine your seasoning will go well with tomatoes, you’re likely fine. There’s basically a world of possibilities. I can imagine cinnamon, cumin, caraway, ground peppers, curry blends, etc. all being wonderful additions. I talk more about toppings down below, but the tart dough is basically a blank, buttery canvas to experiment with.

              A Book Review
        </h1>

        <p>
            A book review is a critical analysis of a book that provides readers with an informed perspective on the book's content, style, and quality
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <h5> Book Name : Alchemist</h5>
            I am not an avid reader but of late I have been trying to read more books than I did before. I think for me the problem is not reading a book but actually taking the step to reading one. Reading is important because it helps in self development and mental stimulation. I recently read “The Alchemist” after procrastinating for along time. I read it at a perfect time after a friend recommended it. The book is lovely and an inspirational masterpiece.
        </p>

            <h4> About the Book</h4>
            Written by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho in 1988. It was initially written and published in Portuguese. It is an international bestseller and has been translated to more than 70 languages. The book is relatively short having around 167 pages only. The theme is about finding one’s destiny or purpose in life.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Plot </h4>
            The story is about a Shepherd boy from Spain whose name is Santiago. He keeps getting the same dream about treasures that are lying in the Pyramids of Egypt. He embarks on a journey to follow his dream after meeting an old king who offers him magic stones and advice. Santiago crosses the Mediterranean and Sahara to find his treasures in Egypt and also accomplish his personal legend which is his purpose in life. The book details his journey and the various encounters that he experiences when following his dream. Throughout the journey, Santiago meets many new people and a lot of difficulty which ultimately helps him to learn and grow the entire way. Does he find the treasures in the Pyramids of Egypt?.

            <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
            The Alchemist is a fantastic book and the storytelling is beautiful. The choice of words are impeccable, full of wisdom and philosophy . I totally loved it. The story is very enchanting and bursts with optimism which I think is very important in our lives. The book shows that the journey to your destiny is as important as the destiny itself. I love how the book emphasizes on the importance of faith, hope and spirituality through the story of an ordinary boy. I think this book appeals to everyone because we all have dreams and sometimes we just want someone to tell us that they may come true. Overall,”The Alchemist”is a very exciting fiction novel and it deserves a space at everyone’s bookshelf.

            <h4>Favorite quotes from the book</h4>

            “One’s Personal Legend(destiny) is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. “At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend….whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist <br> <br>

“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

<br>
<br>

“If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.”Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

<br>
<br>

“Love is not to be found in someone else but in ourselves; we simply awaken it. But in order to do that, we need the other person.”Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

<br>
<br>

“One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.” Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

<br>
<br>

“You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. It’s just a matter of paying attention to this miracle.” Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

<br>
<br>

“It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

<br>
<br>

“There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
